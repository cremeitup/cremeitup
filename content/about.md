## Our Story

Crème It Up was born from a simple belief: everyone deserves to experience the joy of freshly baked, handcrafted desserts. Founded by **Chef Anushka Madaan** in Chandigarh, we've grown from a small home bakery into one of the tricity's most loved bakery studios.

Located in **Sector 46C, Chandigarh**, our studio is where desserts are dreamed, crafted, and taught with love. Every creation is a reflection of our creativity, and every class is a step towards helping you master the joy of baking.

## Chef Anushka Madaan

With over **5 years of pastry experience**, Chef Anushka Madaan creates desserts that balance artistry with flavour. Trained in French pastry techniques, she brings a unique blend of European finesse and Indian warmth to every creation.

Every item at Crème It Up is baked fresh at our Sector 46C studio in Chandigarh using premium ingredients: French butter, Belgian chocolate, and organic flour. No preservatives, no shortcuts just honest, handcrafted baking.

Beyond the oven, Anushka teaches the craft through intimate workshops that have trained hundreds of aspiring bakers. Whether you're a complete beginner or a seasoned home baker, there's a class designed for you.
