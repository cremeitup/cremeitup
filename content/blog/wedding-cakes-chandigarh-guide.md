A wedding cake is more than dessert  - it's the centrepiece of your celebration. If you're planning a wedding in **Chandigarh, Mohali, or Panchkula**, here's everything you need to know about getting the perfect cake.

## Wedding Cake Trends in Chandigarh (2025)

### 1. Minimalist Elegance
Clean lines, muted colours, and simple floral accents. The "less is more" trend is huge in Chandigarh weddings right now.

### 2. Textured Buttercream
Rustic, swirled buttercream finishes are replacing smooth fondant. More natural, more delicious.

### 3. Dessert Tables
Instead of one large cake, couples are doing a curated spread  - a cutting cake plus macarons, eclairs, mini tarts, and cookies.

### 4. Indian Fusion
Rose, pistachio, saffron, and cardamom flavours in a Western cake format. The best of both worlds.
