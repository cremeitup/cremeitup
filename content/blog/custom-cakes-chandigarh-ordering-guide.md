## When Should You Order?

- **Wedding cakes**  - 2-4 weeks in advance (especially during wedding season)
- **Corporate orders**  - 1 week minimum
- **Same-day**  - Some bakeries accommodate, but expect limited options

## How to Brief Your Baker

When reaching out to a bakery in Chandigarh for a custom cake, include:

- **Date and time** you need it
- **Number of servings** (or weight in kg)

- **Design reference**  - a photo or Pinterest board helps
- **Any special requirements**  - so the baker can suggest the best options
