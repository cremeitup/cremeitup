Whether it's a milestone birthday, a wedding, or just a Sunday treat  - a **custom cake from a Chandigarh bakery** makes any occasion special. Here's everything you need to know before placing your order.

## When Should You Order?

- **Birthday cakes**  - At least 2-3 days in advance
- **Wedding cakes**  - 2-4 weeks in advance (especially during wedding season)
- **Corporate orders**  - 1 week minimum
- **Same-day**  - Some bakeries accommodate, but expect limited options

## What Affects the Price?

Custom cake pricing in Chandigarh typically depends on:

1. **Size**  - From 500g (serves 4-6) to multi-tier (serves 50+)
2. **Design complexity**  - Fondant sculpting costs more than buttercream
3. **Flavours**  - Premium flavours (Belgian chocolate, pistachio, passion fruit) cost more than vanilla
4. **Add-ons**  - Edible prints, fresh flowers, cake toppers

## How to Brief Your Baker

When reaching out to a bakery in Chandigarh for a custom cake, include:

- **Date and time** you need it
- **Number of servings** (or weight in kg)
- **Flavour preferences** and any allergies
- **Design reference**  - a photo or Pinterest board helps
- **Budget**  - so the baker can suggest realistic options
