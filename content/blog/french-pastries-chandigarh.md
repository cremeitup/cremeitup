French pastry has a reputation for being intimidating — all that lamination, tempering, and precise technique. But in Chandigarh, a growing number of bakers are bringing **authentic French patisserie** to the tricity.

## What Makes French Pastry "Authentic"?

It's not just about the name on the menu. Real French pastries require:

- **Proper lamination** — A croissant should have visible, flaky layers
- **French butter** — Higher fat content than regular butter, creating richer flavour
- **Patience** — Good croissant dough is folded and rested over 2-3 days
- **Technique** — Choux pastry, pate sablee, and creme patissiere are foundational skills

If your "croissant" is soft and bready with no visible layers, it's just a shaped roll.

## French Pastries You Should Try

### Croissant
The ultimate test of a bakery. Look for a golden, shattery exterior and honeycomb interior. At Creme It Up, our croissants use 27 layers of French butter lamination.

### Macaron
Not to be confused with the coconut macaroon. Real French macarons have a smooth shell, ruffled "feet," and a chewy interior. Common flavours in Chandigarh: pistachio, rose, chocolate, and salted caramel.

### Eclair
Choux pastry filled with creme patissiere and glazed. Should be light, not doughy.

### Tarte au Citron
A lemon tart with a crisp pate sucree shell and tangy curd. Simple but requires perfect balance.
